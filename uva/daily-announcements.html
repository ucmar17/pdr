## Returning of lab grades
- We aim to have them returned one "week" later
  - Read: 10 days after the post-lab is due
- So lab 1 is to be returned today
- Grading guidelines are posted in the Collab wiki
- Once returned, you have one "week" (read: 10 days) to submit a regrade
- A regrade is ONLY if we screwed up the grading
  - It is NOT a chance for you to re-do the work
- We will be VERY strict about the 10 day regrade window!
- You can fill out a regrade via the [regrades course tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php)

## Pop Quiz!

I have worked on [Lab 2](../../labs/lab02/index.html) (lists), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.
